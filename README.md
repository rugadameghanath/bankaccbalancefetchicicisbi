# bankaccbalancefetchicicisbi
When you are lazy to type user name and password of multiple family members to check balances on daily basis, this is the solution based on python for selenium with chrome webdriver.

in the below line in the code, you need to replace with actual credentials.

credentials=('sbiusername1','sbipassword1','SBI','sbiusername2','sbipassword2','SBI','sbiusername3','sbipassword3','SBI','iciciusername1','icicipassword1','ICI');

This code will hold good as long as both SBI and ICICI bank logins have single savings account to be checked.
